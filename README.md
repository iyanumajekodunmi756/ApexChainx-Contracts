# ApexChainx Smart Contracts

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is ApexChainx?

ApexChainx is a smart contract platform built on the Stellar network for
deterministic SLA (Service Level Agreement) calculation, payment escrow,
and multi-party settlement.

### What blockchain does this use?

These contracts run on the **Stellar network** using the **Soroban** smart
contract platform.

### How is SLA calculated?

The contract takes severity level, measured MTTR (Mean Time To Repair), and
configured thresholds to determine whether SLA targets were met. Results include
status (met/violated), payment type (reward/penalty), and rating.

### Can I call contracts directly from the frontend?

**No.** All contract invocations must go through the backend API layer. The
frontend never interacts with contracts directly.

### How are contract upgrades handled?

The contract includes a version negotiation protocol (`get_version_info()`) that
allows backends to verify compatibility before deployment.

### What stops an operator from spamming the same outage ID?

`calculate_sla` is idempotent: resubmitting an outage with an unchanged config
hash and identical inputs returns the stored result and writes nothing — no
history entry, no statistics, no telemetry, no events — so retries are safe and
cannot skew reported violation rates. Resubmitting the *same* outage with
different inputs is rejected (`DuplicateOutageInput`), and a config change opens
a new stored generation for that outage, capped at 16 retained entries
(`OutageRecalcLimit`) so one outage cannot crowd others out of the retention
window. Admin pruning frees that headroom again.

### Is the contract upgradeable?

No. The contract is not natively upgradeable. Upgrades require deploying a new
contract and migrating state through the backend.
